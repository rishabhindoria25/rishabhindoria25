### Hi there, I'm Rishabh! 👋

🎓 **Educational Background:**  
I'm currently a Graduate student at Northeastern University, Boston, pursuing a Masters in Information Systems. My academic journey is deeply rooted in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Artificial Intelligence. Recently, I completed a course in Neural Networks, where I successfully developed a unified model for multi-class gender and emotion classification.

🏢 **Professional Experience:**  
Before joining Northeastern, I enhanced my skills in the industry in various roles:
- **Lead Data Scientist at [Urja.io](https://urja.io), New Delhi:** Specialized in time-series forecasting, A/B testing, and pipeline development.
- **Software Engineer at [Societe Generale Global Solutions](https://globalsolutioncenter.societegenerale.in/en/), Bengaluru:** Focused on NLP transcript redactions, fraud detection, and risk management.

🧑‍💻 **Current Projects:**  
I am passionately working on a project involving meteorological time-series data and satellite cloud cover images from Traverse City. This project involves extensive data pre-processing, feature engineering, and image feature extraction. I have crafted and trained a ConvLSTM Model for Rainfall Forecasting, achieving an impressive 73% Class-1 Accuracy.
